			<p class="description"> Komodo dragons, or Komodo monitors, are the largest, heaviest lizards in the world â€” and one of the few with a venomous bite. These stealthy, powerful hunters rely on their sense of smell to detect food, using their long, forked tongues to sample the air. They can spend hours waiting for a sizable meal to wander within range before launching a deadly attack with their large, curved and serrated teeth.</p>
